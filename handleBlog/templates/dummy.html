Certainly, we can adjust the `home` function to fetch comments for each blog individually. Here's an updated version of the `home` function that retrieves both blogs and their associated comments:

python
def home(request):
    blogs = Blog.objects.all()

    # Create a dictionary to store comments for each blog
    blog_comments = {}
    for blog in blogs:
        # Get comments related to the current blog
        comments = Comment.objects.filter(blog_id=blog.blog_id)
        # Store comments in the dictionary with blog_id as key
        blog_comments[blog.blog_i] = commentsd

    return render(request, 'home.html', {'blogs': blogs, 'blog_comments': blog_comments})


Then, in your template, you can iterate over both `blogs` and `blog_comments` to display the blogs along with their respective comments:

html
{% for field in blogs %}
    <!-- Display blog content -->
    <!-- Your existing blog display code -->

    <!-- Display comments for this specific blog -->
    {% for comment in blog_comments[field.blog_id] %}
        <div class="card-block px-6 ">
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center font-bold">
                <p class="mb-1">
                    {{ comment.commentersName }} <span class="small">{{ comment.commentDate }}</span>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="small mb-0">
                {{ comment.commentContent }}
            </p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}


This approach ensures that comments are fetched specifically for each blog post and displayed accordingly. Make sure to adjust your template accordingly.
